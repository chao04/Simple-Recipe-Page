<h2>What is fried rice?</h2>
<p>
  Fried rice is a traditional Chinese preparation of cooked rice,
  vegetables, protein, soy sauce, and aromatics. The ingredients are 
  stir-fried in a large pan or wok for even flavor distribution. An ideal
   use for leftovers, fried rice is quick, customizable, and incredibly simple 
   to put together with whatever is in your fridge.
