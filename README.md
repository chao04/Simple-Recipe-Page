# Simple-Recipe-Page
Recipe Project
Really cool project, helped me implement and use skills that I learnt, had to figure out how to click on the image to go to that page, but managed easily as I have learnt this before but forgot.

Getting real comfortable with git commands 
Getting real comfortable with boiler template
Getting real comfortable of starting a simple project

Seen other peoples recipes and wow, hope I can style like them too.
Next goals it to learn more css to help style center, make a nice layout for my next recipe project, cant wait!
